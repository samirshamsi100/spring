== CRUD - Spring Boot - Sample Product catalog

IMPORTANT: You can run and interact with this application on localhost. This application runs when deployed on OpenShift with a PostgreSQL database. For more details on using this booster with a single-node OpenShift cluster refer below. This application requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x or greater.



== Running the Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your application there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your application to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
# Login with a user that can create a project

$ oc new-project product

$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests 

----

== Interacting with the Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster

To interact with your booster while it's running on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster, you first need to obtain it's URL:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route MY_APP_NAME -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

MY_APP_NAME-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME
----


You can use the form at your application's url or you can use the `curl` command:

.List all entries in the database
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://MY_APP_NAME-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/product

----

.Retrieve an entry with a specific ID
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
curl http://MY_APP_NAME-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/product/{itemId}

----


.Create a new entry:
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"Product", "description" : "Product Description", "price" : "10.00"}'  http://MY_APP_NAME-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/product

----


.Update an Entry
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"itemId":"354255", "name":"Product", "description" : "Product Description", "price" : "10.00"}'   http://MY_APP_NAME-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/product/(itemId)

----
